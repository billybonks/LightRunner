Notes:
SetContinuousPhysics if true. can be false to improve performance.
Box2D prefers fixed timestap. I didn't give a shit about this.
 @warning These functions draws the Line, Point, Polygon, immediately. They aren't batched. If you are going to make a game that depends on these primitives, I suggest creating a batch.
 removed debugdraw files and draw and init code and import
//er: tags comments that need to be looked at before release

- Collision Detection with lights
- Box2D pretty light trails
- Better/more random light generator
- increase in speed mechanic test
- play a bit and do some proper game design
